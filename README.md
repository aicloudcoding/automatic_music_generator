-- This is capstone project for my senior year at University. I have approximately 9 more weeks to complete it. 

-- The bare bones of this project will be able to output audio that is generated automatically based off of midi that import as the inputs. This will either be public source midi, or it will be midid that I create.
Ideally it will be my own music. 

-- The stretch goal is developing a GUI with a couple knobs that will allow a user to play with and modify the generated compositions. 

-- I am using jupyternotebooks as the IDE and tensorflow for the machine learning library. 

-- For the GUI I will be using Python libraries.
